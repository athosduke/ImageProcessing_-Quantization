# Digital-Image-Quantization
Designed to understand the effects of spatial and gray-scale resolution changes on a digital image.

# Description
1.Downsampling\
Change (downsample) the spatial resolution to 256x256, 128x128, and 32x32pixels.\
2.Upsampling\
Create an interpolated 512x512 image from 32x32 image.\
3.Grey-level Quantization\
Change the gray-level quantization of the original512x512 image by reducing the numberof bits per pixel from 8 to 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 bits/pixel.\
4.Spacial & Grey-level\
Make a 512x512 image that: (i) changes the spatial resolution to 256x256 pixels and (ii) has 6 bits/pixelgray-scale resolution.
